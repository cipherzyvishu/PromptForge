# Environment Variables for Vercel Deployment

## Required Environment Variables:

### OpenRouter API (Optional - for future AI integration)
- **Variable:** `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- **Value:** Your OpenRouter API key (currently not used since API routes are disabled)

- All features work with mock data and local storage
- Environment variables can be added later when AI integration is restored
